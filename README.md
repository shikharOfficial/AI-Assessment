## Assessment 1: Mini RAG Pipeline with ChromaDB on Colab

### Instructions:
1. Use Google Colab for the task.
2. Take 5â€“10 short documents (you can hardcode them).
3. Preprocess them using basic NLP (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.).
4. Embed the documents using the `sentence-transformers` library.
5. Store the embeddings in **ChromaDB** or **FAISS**.
6. Accept a user query and retrieve the top 2 most relevant documents based on semantic similarity.
7. Use a **HuggingFace LLM** (e.g., distilGPT2 or any open LLM) to generate an answer combining the retrieved documents.

## Assessment 2: Knowledge Graph + Semantic Search + QA

### Instructions:
1. Build a small **RDF knowledge graph** using the `rdflib` library.
   - Example: Alice knows Bob, Bob works at Google, Google is a company.
2. Convert the RDF triples into text format (e.g., "Alice knows Bob").
3. Embed those text sentences using `sentence-transformers`.
4. Store the embeddings in **FAISS**.
5. Accept a user query like: *"Where does Bob work?"*
6. Retrieve the most relevant sentence from the embeddings and use it to answer the query using a small LLM (e.g., `tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b` or `distilgpt2`).
